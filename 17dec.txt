Git is a locally-installed, open-source version control system (VCS), while GitHub is a web-based, cloud-hosted platform that provides a graphical interface and collaboration tools built around the Git software. You use Git to manage code changes on your local machine, and GitHub to share and collaborate on those changes with others online.
so I've installed git in my system ,created a portfolio ,logged into GitHub ,then connected the portfolio to git and made it deployable in a web browser.
